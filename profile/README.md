# Background
Welcome to Project Herophilus, Herophilus was a Greek physician who was an anatomist and credited with being the founder 
of Anatomy. Why would we have chosen this name for our project? Our intent and goal is to lead by example by showing the 
ways platforms and/or innovation with healthcare data and systems integration can be modernized while introducing integration and 
application development as side by side efforts. 

Our mission is to be a premier healthcare community focused on enabling healthcare care to solve data 
challenges and problems. The sole purpose of ALL the capabilities we have built for healthcare
is to focus on enabling <b> Data is the Asset</b> Everything we do is all intended to fall under what we have branded Healthcare Data Foundation (HDF). The way we plan on enabling this is through open source. Our decision to be completely open 
is based on what we have seen in the last decade, open source has powered ALL significant software innovation. 
Here is a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/rhdc/managed-files/rh-enterprise-open-source-report-f27565-202101-en.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> 
that showcases all the various ways open source and it's culture are transforming its importance to enterprises and the way 
new innovation is being delivered. While there are many industries that have benefited from open source there is no 
industry that has potentially benefited more than Healthcare. For many decades it has also relied upon community development 
in areas such as treatment protocols, safety standards, and industry standards based data formats. Now, as we head into a 
new era driven by consumption and secure managed services it is a perfect time in healthcare for open source and
healthcare. 

Our goal is to [leverage industry leading open source technologies](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Platform-Content/Technical/Technologies.md) to help us bring the most widely adopted and used capabilities. Assets currently available provide tools for
configuration, testing, legacy and modern data integration, modern application integration, application development, synthetic data, and more.
All of these assets are available to any organization.

The vision, supporting our mission, helps drive data driven open source capabilities into healthcare while 
demonstrating how healthcare can leverage open source to solve industry problems. In order to deliver our vision and help 
healthcare it was critical that we define [specific design principles](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Platform-Content/Design/DesignPrinciples.md) 
to ensure a very [scalable, extensible and reusable architecture](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Platform-Content/Design/Architecture.md) 
with a focus on enabling specific [capabilities](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Platform-Content/Design/Capabilities.md). 
To help us better tell the industry challenges better we created a [fictitious organization](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Platform-Content/General/FictitiousOrg.md) and ensure we can accurately define and relate any solutions being developed. When it comes to data integration there are a set of 
[industry based integration standards support](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Platform-Content/Design/IntegrationStandardsSupported.md) 
and non industry standard data challenges.

Apart from the links above here are some other key points about our community and what we are working
towards.
- We want everyone to join our [community](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/edit/main/Platform-Content/General/CodeOfConduct.md) and would love whatever contributions resources are comfortable providing. These 
could be code, content, project management, executive steering or in the form of many other activities. We hope you
can help us continually improve in any manner you deem needed.
- Take a look at the [consulting partners](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/blob/main/Platform-Content/Technical/Partner-Implementations.md) that have developed or solution on top of one or more iDaaS components
- Feel free to look at our [roadmap](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Platform-Content/Roadmap/index.md), it is updated monthly
- All the assets within this project are available and provided "as-is" under [Apache 2 licensing](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
- To help and continue improving implementation expericence we have a series of implementation guides developed, please start [here](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/blob/main/Platform-Content/ImplementationGuides/intro.md) to get some instructions on how to implement.

# Key Overall Project Capabilities Provided 
When we first formed our community we went through a very steep learning curve. Over the years we continue to improve. As we head into 2024 our biggest learned
effort is that everything under one open source organization while easier to maintain is not beneficial or functional for the many
that have leveraged our code. For 2024 we have worked to create multiple Git Hub organizations with each organization representing [//]: # (
specific capability it served.
