# Background
Welcome to Project Herophilus, our community is named after a physician considered a key leader in healthcare. Herophilus, 
was a Greek physician who was an anatomist and credited with being the founder of Anatomy. With anatomy being one of the 
foundations for medicine,  and since our focus is around enabling/simplifying and empowering data as the core of healthcare we felt 
this was a very good name for our efforts.

Our mission is to be a premier healthcare community focused on enabling healthcare care to solve data 
challenges and problems. The way we plan on enabling this is through open source. Our decision to be completely open is based on 
the what we have seen in the last decade, open source has powered ALL significant software innovation. Here is a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/rhdc/managed-files/rh-enterprise-open-source-report-f27565-202101-en.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> that showcases all the various ways open source and it's culture are transforming its importance to enterprises and the way new innovation is being delivered.  
While there are many industries that have benefited from opensource there is no industry that has potentially benefited more than Healthcare. For many decades it has also relied upon community development in areas such as treatment protocols, safety standards, and industry standards based data formats. Now, as we head into a new era driven by comsumption and secure managed services it is a perfect time in healthcare for open source and
healthcare.

The vision, supporting our mission, help drive data driven open source capabilities into healthcare while 
demonstrating how healthcare can leverage open source to solve industry problems. In order to deliver our vision and help healthcare it was critical that we define [specific design principles](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Platform-Content/Design/DesignPrinciples.md) to ensure a very [scalable, extensible and reusable architecture](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Platform-Content/Design/Architecture.md) with a focus on enabling specific [capabilities](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Platform-Content/Design/Capabilities.md). 

What differentiatiates Project Herophilus is our focus and intent to enable unifying siloed areas life developers, data integration, application integration, data and data scientists with a cohesive ecosystem approach to solving problems. To help with consistentcy we created a [fictious organization](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Platform-Content/General/FictitiousOrg.md) and ensure we
can accurately define and relate any solutions being developed. When it comes to data integration there are a set of 
[industry based integration standards support](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Platform-Content/Design/IntegrationStandardsSupported.md) and non industry standard data challenges.
At Project Herophilus, we [leverage industry leading open source technologies](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Platform-Content/Technical/Technologies.md) to help us bring the most widely adopted and used capabilities to bear. Assets currently available provide tools for configuration, testing, legacy and modern data integration, modern application integration, synthetic data, and more. All of these assets are available to any organization. The sole purpose of ALL the capabilities we have built for healthcare
is to focus on enabling <b> Data as an Asset</b>

As you think about our mission and vision and look below at all the assets that are available our question to everyone is "who has made more useful capabilities available to any industry?" All the assets are avalable and provided under Apache 2 licensing.

# Core Repositories
To support any iDaaS branded artifact there are a subset of assets avaiable to assist in the implementation : <br/>

| Repository Name | Description |
| ------ | ------------|
|[iDaaS Connect](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/iDaaS-Connect)|Connecting to all types of data and providing access to information in near realtime. It is intended to be a comprehensive set of design patterns, reference architecture, accelerators to help anyone and supports hundreds of connectors from legacy to modern connectivity to industry standards to various public clouds connectivity needs.|
|[iDaaS DREaM](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/iDaaS-DREAM)|Assets designed from multiple technologues that serve a variery of purposes from routing of data to data transformation to business driven data assets.|
|[iDaaS KIC](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/iDaaS-KIC)|Knowledge, Insight and Conformance is all about providing the ability to process errors, audit and other data. This consists of the endpoints, processing and persistence needed to support the platform.|
| [iDaaS Data Simulators](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/iDaaS-DataSimulators)| Having data is one aspect, the other is having tooling that can quickly be configured and used to test components. We have developed a data-simulators for our core components, Simulators to help in implementation and testing.  |   
| [Event Builder](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Event-Builder)| A comprehensive library for parsing and building various types of healthcare industry standards based data.|

# Supporting Efforts and Repositories 
To support any iDaaS branded artifact there are a subset of assets avaiable to assist in the implementation : <br/>

| Add-On | Description |
| ------ | ------------|
| [Project Herophilus Technical Content](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets) | Variety of content specific to iDaaS - PowerPoints, Word Docs, and Draw.IO diagrams|
| [Test Data](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Testing)  | Test data for all healthcare industry standards work|
| [Synthetic Data](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/DataSynthesis)| When it comes to building or testing assets having lots of data to resemble you production data is critical, it also helps drive innovation.
