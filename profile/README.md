# Background
Welcome to Project Herophilus, Herophilus was a Greek physician who was an anatomist and credited with being the founder 
of Anatomy. Why would we have chosen this name for our project? Our intent and goal is to lead by example by showing the 
ways platforms and/or innovation with healthcare data and systems integration can be modernized while introducing integration and 
application development as side by side efforts. 

Our mission is to be a premier healthcare community that enables healthcare care to solve data 
challenges and problems. The sole purpose of ALL the capabilities we have built for healthcare
is to focus on enabling <b> Data is the Asset</b>. Our decision to be completely open 
is based on what we have seen in the last decade: open source has powered ALL significant software innovation. 
Here is a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/rhdc/managed-files/rh-enterprise-open-source-report-f27565-202101-en.pdf" target="_blank">report</a> 
that showcases all the various ways open source and its culture are transforming its importance to enterprises and the way 
new innovation is being delivered. While many industries have benefited from open source, no
industry has potentially benefited more than Healthcare. For many decades, it has also relied upon community development 
in areas such as treatment protocols, safety standards, and industry standards-based data formats.

Our goal is to [leverage industry-leading open source technologies](https://github.com/Project-Herophilus/Project-Herophilus-Assets/tree/main/Platform-Content/Technical/Technologies.md) to help us bring the most widely adopted and used capabilities. Assets currently available provide tools for
configuration, testing, legacy and modern data integration, modern application integration, application development, synthetic data, and more.
All of these assets are available to any organization.

# Key Overall Project Capabilities Provided 
When we first formed our community, we went through a very steep learning curve. Over the years, we have continued to improve. As we head into 2024, our biggest learned
effort is that everything under one open-source organization, while easier to maintain, is not beneficial or functional for the many
who have leveraged our community efforts. For 2024, we have worked to create multiple Git Hub organizations, with each organization representing 
specific capabilities it serves.

<b>Aside from specific content-related sites, any repositories directly on this site have not been maintained since November 2023 and have all been moved to their respective new Git Hub organization.</b>
